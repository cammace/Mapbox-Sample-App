#Mapbox Sample App
This is an Android app to demonstrate some of the abilities developers have using Mapbox gl, Directions and geocoder APIs

**If using Android Marshmallow (6.0) or above, make sure to grant location permissions in settings**  
Haven't had time to implement permissions like your suppose to yet

[Mapbox Geocoder API](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-geocoder-android)  
[Mapbox Directions API](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-directions-android)  
[Mapbox gl](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/)

###Current Features
  * Navigate map freely with ability to find location
  * Search place address with instant autocomplete
  * Tap marker and then car logo to get driving direction
  
###Known bugs
  * Sometimes infoWindow covers up marker when showing and is off center
  * Turn-by-turn directions in navigation mode haven't been implemented yet
  * Unable to choose route
